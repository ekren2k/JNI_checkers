# **JNI checkers**
## Brief description
This is my first project from UTP subject at my university. The task was to make a board game using Java for rendering GUI and C++ for the game logic.
Using JNI we can retreive data from C++ in real time and render game elements according to the state of our board. Later on various Unit test had to be
implemented to ensure proper work of the mechanics such as board initialization, move handling and etc.
